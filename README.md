# HTML project with a little bit of CSS and XML

This project have been written in couple of hours for one of my courses.
It's pretty simple, nothing special, but it was my first expierence with CSS and XML, so I thought it's alright to share it.

index.htm is the main page of the site - the other files are mainly subpages and images.

XML folder contains XML and XML schema files, I had to use them to meet the requirements of the project (which are in hihproject.pdf file, unfortunately in Polish).
